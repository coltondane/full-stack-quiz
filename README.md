# full-stack-quiz
An application that tests the knowledge of full stack web developers in a dynamic and interactive way.

## Description

    This application was created to give users a knowledge test on some full stack coding logic so as to see if they may need to do some more studying. Working on this application really tested my own knowledge and application of JavaScript logic to get the quiz to function correctly. To get this quiz to work, I used a combination of HTML quereys, functions, event-listeners, local storage, conditionals, intervals, alerts, google fonts, and array elements.  

    This application implements JavaScript in conjunction with HTML and CSS to display a quiz to the user, and to then record their timer score and keep track of the user responses to the questions.

## Usage

    When the user opens the application they will see a start screen providing a brief description of how the quiz works. When the user presses the start button the first section of JavaScript executes, displaying the question screen, along with the first set of questions and the timer interval. If the user selects the correct answer, they will be alerted, and must confirm to continue to the next. The same will occur if they answer incorrectly, but 10 seconds will be taken off the timer as a punishment. If the timer runs out, or if the user answers all the questions, the user is alerted that the quiz has ended. Afterwards they will see a screen that displays their final score, as well as an entry box to input their initials. After they do so, the user will see their score displayed on the high scores screen. The high scores screen will also display the score and users initials that were input last by accessing the local storage if they press the 'HIGH SCORES' button on the start screen.
